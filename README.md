**Super Simple Ugly Google Trends API**

Given the google trends search and the desired directory, this ugly program will download the CSV. This will not work in headless mode since the window has to be a specific height in order to have the download .CSV button.

1) Set the ChromeDriver
2) Set the desired directory
3) Change the keyword if necessary
